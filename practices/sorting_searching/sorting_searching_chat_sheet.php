As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I can provide you with a list of PHP functions that are commonly used for sorting and searching in arrays. Please note that PHP may have had new releases and updates since then, so be sure to check the PHP documentation for the most up-to-date information on functions and their usage.

For sorting arrays, you can use functions like:

sort(): Sorts an array in ascending order.
rsort(): Sorts an array in descending order.
asort(): Sorts an associative array in ascending order, maintaining key-value associations.
arsort(): Sorts an associative array in descending order, maintaining key-value associations.
ksort(): Sorts an associative array by keys in ascending order.
krsort(): Sorts an associative array by keys in descending order.
usort(): Sorts an array using a user-defined comparison function.
uasort(): Sorts an associative array using a user-defined comparison function, maintaining key-value associations.
uksort(): Sorts an associative array by keys using a user-defined comparison function.
For searching in arrays, you can use functions like:

in_array(): Checks if a value exists in an array.
array_search(): Searches for a value in an array and returns the corresponding key if found.
array_key_exists(): Checks if a key exists in an array.
array_filter(): Filters elements of an array using a callback function.
array_walk(): Apply a user-defined function to each element of an array.
Please note that PHP's features and functions may evolve with each new release. You should check the official PHP documentation for the version you're using to get the most up-to-date information on PHP functions for sorting and searching. You can visit the PHP documentation here: PHP Documentation.
